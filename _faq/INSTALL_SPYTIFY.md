Here's how to download, extract and open Spytify.

- Download Spytify-v.`X`.`Y`.`Z`.zip in the assets section of the latest release.
- Extract all the content of the zip file.
- Find `Spytify.exe` and run it.
- If a blue pop-up appears, it's a warning that comes from Windows Defender since Spytify is not registered in Microsoft Store, they do that to protect your PC against malwares or unknown publisher. Spytify is an unknown publisher because I provide this software for free and I'm just one guy, so no good reason for me to pay Microsoft to get a valid developper license. You just have to trust me, or trust the code, it's available on GitHub. So to open the app, click on _More Info_ then on _Run anyway_ and the app should appear.

> If `Spytify.exe` cannot be found, make sure your security software did not remove it.
