Here's how to download, extract and open Spytify.

- Download Spytify-v._X_._Y_._Z_.zip in the assets section of the latest release.
- Extract all the content of the zip file.
- Find `Spytify.exe` and run it.
- If a pop-up appears, it's a warning that comes from Windows Defender because Spytify is not registered to Microsoft Store. They prompt that message to protect you and your PC against malwares and/or unknown publisher. Spytify is an unknown publisher because I decide to not make a profit fom this software, I provide it for free, I'm not a company, so I have no good reason to pay Microsoft to get a developper license and remove that warning. You just have to trust me or trust the code (available on GitHub). So to open the app, click on _More Info_ then on _Run anyway_ and the app should appear.

> If _Spytify.exe_ cannot be found, make sure your security software did not remove it.
