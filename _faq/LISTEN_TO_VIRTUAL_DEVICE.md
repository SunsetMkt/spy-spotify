[Virtual Audio Device](#install-better-audio-endpoint-device) are a good way to isolate apps together and get better recordings quality. However, by default, the apps you set on this device cannot be heard once you move them to this device, even if you change your default audio device for this one.

To be able to still listen to Spotify when you are recording with Spytify with a Virtual Audio Cable device. You can set the Windows option `Listen to this device` in the device properties.

Right click on the Audio ðŸ”‰ icon in the taskbar and select **Open Sound settings**, go down to the _Sound_ section and select **Sound Control Panel**. In the _Recording_ tab, select the **CABLE Output** device, then click on **Properties**. In the Device properties window, under _Listen_ tab, check the option `Listen to this device`.

If you [isolated Spotify and Spytify properly on the virutal audio device](#isolate-spotify-audio-endpoint), you can leave **Default Playback Device** selected for the _Playback through this device_ option, otherwise if your default playback is somehow a different one than your headset/speaker, select it in the dropdown list. If the selected playback device is always the same one, you could leave Spytify and Spotify on the virtual cable as long as you want to be able to record great quality at anytime and still listen to your music.

Click **Apply** and you should now hear it (and it won't record YouTube or other background noise).
